            <p>• 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
                The purpose of IT in modern businesses is to be a business enabler. It was created to assist businesses and improve effectiveness.
                If the IT System goes down in an organisation, it can have catastrophic consequences on the departments that rely on it and 
                the business as a whole from both a productivity and revenue generation perspective.

            <p>• 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful? 
                What tools? What skills?
                
                Tools 
                The IT skills market is constantly changing and evolving as new technologies are introduced. Those with the relevant skills are vital for projects to succeed
                Skills
                It is essential to have good project management skills, alongside effective communication and time management skills when undergoing a digital project.
                Effective IT systems play a large part in regard to the building and communication of projects and project phases, without this technology, creating the end product would not be viable.</p>

            <p>• 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.
                I will include the required course information and questions and break them down into manageable tasks, ensuring I keep up to date on tasks I am doing and tasks yet to be completed.
                Trello is particularly helpful in this instance as it keeps me up to date on the exact tasks every step of the way.
                I also drew a basic layout of how I wanted the site to look and followed this as a basic guide.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>• 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
                There are a number of reasons projects fail but the main reasons usually fall into a few brackets: Misalignment with business processes, Lack of cross-functional expertise,
                Limited digital strategy, Fixed plans that don’t account for change. Although it is uncommon for digital projects to fail, they can do so for these reasons.

            <hr>
            <p>• 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. - 
                How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
                Using both Trello and Visual Studio have been useful throughout the creation of my website. 
                
                Trello has helped to keep the project on track by highlighting 
                the tasks I have completed, those in the process of completion and those yet to complete.
                Visual Studio has been paramount to the coding of the site as all coding has been performed with the use of VS.
                Github can be useful as it lets you upload your code and then host the site so we can view the webpage as intended on a browser. It also aids with version control as the code you upload
                can be your most 'up to date' version and will remain available for you on your Github account of changes are required.</p> 
            <hr>
            <p>• 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - How does GDPR impact digital projects?
                The Guide to the GDPR is part of our Guide to Data Protection. It is for DPOs and others who have day-to-day responsibility for data protection.
                
                It explains the general data protection regime that applies to most UK businesses and organisations. It covers the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as it applies in the UK, tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018.
                It explains each of the data protection principles, rights and obligations. It summarises the key points you need to know, answers frequently asked questions, and contains practical checklists to help you comply.
                Where relevant, this guide also links to more detailed guidance and other resources, including ICO guidance, statutory ICO codes of practice, and European guidance published by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).

            <p>Unit 2, Outcome 1
                • 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
                Copyright is used to protect the content creator's intellectual property from being freely used without expressed permission. This is an issue as the creator does not receive royalties or credit when someone else takes credit for their work. I didn't use any copyrighted material during the project, however if the project was something commercial, I would ensure that the content was copyright free and free to use for commercial purposes.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>• 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
                Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:
            <br>    
                -auditory
                -cognitive
                -neurological
                -physical
                -speech
                -visual
            <br>    
                To work around these issues, many people use assistive technologies to browse the internet. 
                This includes screen readers that vocalize the text on each page, speech recognition software that converts speech into text, Braille terminals, and even alternative keyboards that accommodate special needs.
            <br>    
                I have not included any accessibility features into the site but I understand that if I had more time, I could potentially include some of the afore mentioned factors to facilitate users with disabilities.

            <p>• 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
            <br>

                HTML was  vital filetype for the website as this was the language it was coded in, without HTML building of the site would not have been possible. Some other useful and commonly seen filetypes to take into account when creating a website are:
            <br>    
                AVI - Audio/Video Interleaved.
                CSS - Cascading StyleSheet.
                DOC - Microsoft Word DOCument.
                EXE - EXEcutable file.
                GIF - Graphics Interchange Format.
                HTML/ . HTM - HyperText Markup Language file.
                JPG/ . JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group file.
                MIDI/ . MID - Musical Instrument Digital Interface.

            <p>Unit 1, Outcome 2 
                • 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
                Using both Trello and Visual Studio have been useful throughout the creation of my website. Trello has helped to keep the project on track by highlighting 
                the tasks I have completed, those in the process of completion and those yet to complete.
                Visual Studio has been paramount to the coding of the site as all coding has been performed with the use of VS.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>• 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
                In my opinion, both Trello and VS were appropriate for the project as Trello keeps the project on track and VS enables the project to be created.
                VS was useful as a single piece of software that enabled all the coding to be performed without the use of any other tools.
                It may have been useful to have another project management tool as an option to compare Trello with. Despite this, the tools at hand were efficient enough to complete the project.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>• 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
                In general, I'm happy with how my website has turned out. Althogh it is relatively simplistic, it is easy to navigate and the layout facilitiates navigation.
                I would have like to include some extras for example, a light box with imagery or some other moxing text to make the site experience more dyamic.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>• 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
                I wanted to ensure that the site has no majoy errors, that the appropriate links are working and that the site functions as intended. 
                I had to change the overall layout as it included too many pages that were unneccesary and I changed the colour scheme and banner as they were not visually pleasing.</p> 
            <hr>
            <p>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) 
                • 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency - could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
                I think I could have been slightly more productive when it came to developing the website. In terms of Trello, it has been a useful tool, however, sometimes it easy to forget to use or update it after completing tasks.
                I think I could have worked well as part of a team for this project as learning basic HTML and CSS did not come as easy to me as it did to others.
                Working in a team would have enabled me to collaborate with team-mates and potentially learned more by asking questions and watching others solve problems.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>• 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
                Trello has been useful for improving productivity throughout the course of the project. I believe I could have also spent more time outside the classroom solo working or perhaps watching online tutorials 
                or using other self learning methods more to better understand HTML / CSS and produce a better, more dynamic website as a result.</p>    
            <hr>
            <p>• 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects - what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
                I would work in a team next time if given the option. I would appoint a "project Manager" who would be in charge of the Trello aspect of the project and who would also assign tasks to each member of the group respectively.
                In terms of other technology, Slack is useful in team scenarios to share idea and code snippets and also communicate - whether that e used as a yardstick to measure productivity or as a tool to collaborate code.
                In relation to code sharing, we could also use GitHub to ensure our latest code is up to date.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>• 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
                To test digital solutions I would ensure that I (or someone) perform user testing of the solution in question to ensure that it works as desired.
                If something goes wrong during the test or does not work as intended, it can then be reported and amended accordingly.
                It is then essential that the testing is performed again to ensure the fix has addressed the issue and the error no longer occurs.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Unit 2, Outcome 1 
                • 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
                My website is split into 4 sections (pages) which are as follows: Home, About me, Contact, Questions.
            <br>    
                The color scheme is constant throughout the site to give a uniform feel to the user experience. I have opted for an image of the sky as the central image.
                The background is a silver/grey colour and the banner behind the navigation bar is blue.
            <br>    
                Home:- This page includes basic information about the site
                About me:- This page includes an introduction to myself and why I enrolled on the Code Nation course
                Contact:- This page includes my contact details in the form of a flex box with different social media links and other forms of contact included.
                Questions:- The questions section includes my answers to the course module questions for the intention of the examiners.</p>
