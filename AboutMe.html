       	  <h3>A little bit about Mark</h3>
        	<p>My name is Mark I have a background in IT/Cyber Security Sales which I have been doing for the last 3 years.
				I studied Business Management at Roehampton University in London and achieved a 2:1 BSc Honors Degree.</p>
			<br>	
        	<p>I came to Code Nation after hearing about the opportunity via the Job Centre and having little experience in coding,
				jumped at the opportunity to expand my skillset and skill up in a subject that has a high demand in the workplace.</p>
			<br>	
			<p>So far, I have grasped a basic understading of some the Python coding language and, as part of a team, have
				put those skills to the test and build a text-based adventure game. The experience proved both challenging and rewarding simiultaneously.</p>
